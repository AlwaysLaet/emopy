This leads us to search by first looking for `A+B`; if that's not there, then search for `A`; if not there, then `B`. This is the perspective of ordering longer-to-shorter when we search."

Moreover, as it will look like analogous to `((A+B)|(A)|(B))`, the inner parentheses will help divvy up the finding, returning a tuple `tup` for each found emoji, with the first element `tup[0]` being the actual found emoji and the remaining entries `tup[1:]` being having the same number of entries as inner parentheses, with entry `''` if the emoji was not found or `'<emoji>'` if the emoji was found. For example, if we had the text `s=\"lorem ipsum A+B\"`, then `re.findall('((A+B)|(A)|(B))', s)` would result in the list of tuples `[('A+B', 'A+B', '', '')]`; where as with the text `s2=\"lorem ipsum A B\"`, the result of `re.findall('((A+B)|(A)|(B))', s2)` would be the list of tuples `[('A','','A',''), ('B','','','B')]`.
